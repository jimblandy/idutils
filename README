This is the GNU idutils package.

It provides simple, fast, high-capacity, language-independent
identifier database tools.  Actually, the term `identifier' is too
limiting--`mkid' stores tokens, be they program identifiers of any
form, literal numbers, or words of human-readable text.  Database
queries can be issued from the command-line, or from within emacs,
serving as an augmented tags facility.

`mkid' was originally written by Greg McGary <gkm@gnu.ai.mit.edu>
and posted to comp.sources.unix in September 1987.  It was then
maintained and enhanced by a loose knit group of programmers on the
Internet led by Tom Horsley <Tom.Horsley@mail.hcsc.com>.  Tom released
`mkid2' on comp.sources.unix in March, 1991.  Greg McGary resumed
maintenance until 2000.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to
<bug-idutils@gnu.org>.

Please describe bugs completely: your input, what you expected, what you
got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but please include a
description of the problem as well, since this is sometimes difficult to
infer.
